About KFC
KFC has been around for almost 9 decades since its inception in 1930. Colone Sanders is the founding father of this company and his image is most prominently used in the company’s logo and advertising. And its name at the time of founding was Sanders Court and Cafe and then, later on, changed the name to KFC. It was one of the first American Restaurants to expand its services to an international base.

KFC also became the first Western franchise to open up a franchise in China. Coming on to its products, it specializes in Fried Chicken, as the name Kentucky Fried Chicken suggests. Apart from the pressure fried chicken, KFC also serves Chicken Fillet Sandwiches, wraps, side dishes, salads, and a lot more.
